			2. Provisions Regarding Groups<br /><br />
			2.1 Group Qualifications:  Any group that desires to register as a group with GroupPost must meet the following requirements:<br /><br />
			2.1.1 What is a “Group”?  A “group” must consist of two (2) or more Users, whose purpose for existence is legal; ethical; and in good taste, as determined by GroupPost at its sole discretion.<br /><br />
			2.1.2 Group Removal: Without notice and without opportunity to oppose the same, GroupPost, at its sole discretion and judgment may remove any group that is not qualified to be a group under the terms of this User Agreement, or the group has not sent a Message to one or more Users for a period of one year or more. Additionally, GroupPost, at its sole discretion and judgment, without notice and without opportunity to oppose the same, may remove any group it believes, at its sole discretion, to be in violation of this Agreement or is not qualified to participate in GroupPost as a group.<br /><br />
			2.2 Creating/Registering a Group <br /><br />
			2.2.1 User Qualifications:  To register (i.e. create) a group in GroupPost, you must be a User, and you must be 18 years of age or older.  The User, who registers a group, is the group’s first “Primary Administrator” (see Section 2.3.2). <br /><br />
			2.2.2 Uniqueness:  Any particular group may be registered only once with GroupPost.  Yet, branches or divisions of groups may register as separate groups.  (For example, Martin Luther King High School may register as a group as well as the Marching Band of Martin Luther King High School.  Each of these groups will be administered separately. In the event a group is erroneous registered more than once, the registration earlier in time will be given preference.  GroupPost, at its discretion, may remove and delete any subsequent duplicitous registrations.<br /><br />
			2.2.3 Truthful Information:  You agree to only provide information that is true and accurate regarding the group you are registering.  In the event, GroupPost discovers that information provided is not truthful and accurate; we have the right to remove and delete the group, which could have detrimental effects on the group.<br /><br />
			2.3  Group Administrators  <br /><br />
			2.3.1 Administrator(s):  Administrators (i.e. Followers with management authority within a group, aka “Admin”) are Followers who have the authority to manage a group.  Every group must have at least one Follower of the group as an Admin and at least one Follower who is the “Primary Admin”. <br /><br />
			2.3.2 Primary Admin:  The User who creates/registers a new group in GroupPost will automatically be designated as the original Primary Admin.  Only the current Primary Admin can designate another Admin as a new Primary Admin. (In the event a group’s Primary Administrator is unavailable to designate a new Primary Administrator, the group should contact GroupPost at help@grouppost.com.)  Any group’s Primary Admin, at his/her discretion, can designate any other Administrator as the new Primary Admin. (To remove a User as the Primary Admin, the Primary Admin must designate another Admin as the new Primary Admin, who can then remove the former Primary Admin as an Admin.)<br /><br />
			2.3.3 Admins Authority: A group may designate as many Followers as it deems appropriate to manage the group (i.e. Admins). All Admins have the same authority as other Admins except no Admin can remove the “Primary Admin” as an Admin.  All Admins has the authority to:  (1) Invite and approve Users as Followers of the group; (2) Remove Followers from the group; (3) Send Messages to Followers with or without attachments; (4) Link Messages to social media (e.g. Facebook); (5) Add and remove Admins (except the Primary Admin); and (6) Exercise other authority as GroupPost may allow from time-to-time. <br /><br />
			2.4 Following a Group <br /><br />
			2.4.1 Approval:  Registered groups must approve Users before they may follow the group.  This can be done by a group member (non-Admin) invites a prospective Follower, who must be approved by a group Admin before allowed to follow the group, or if a group Admin invites a prospective Follower via a group’s management page, that prospective Follower will be automatically approved as a Follower by virtue of his/her invitation by an Admin via a group’s management page.<br /><br />
			2.4.2 Discretion:  At their sole discretion, registered groups may place Users in various sub-groups (see Section 2.5).<br /><br />
			2.4.3 Removal:  At his/her sole discretion, registered groups’ Admin(s) may remove any User as a Follower.  Likewise, any User can elect to remove himself/herself from any group followed.<br /><br />
			2.4.4 Privacy:  See the GroupPost Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
			2.4.5 User Election: You may follow any group that approves you as a Follower.<br /><br />
			2.4.6 Notices to Groups:  Notices from GroupPost to registered groups will be made by GroupPost sending the email account(s) of the group’s Admin(s), as is then currently contained in the User Setting of User’s who are designated as an Admin for one of more groups.  GroupPost sending such notice to any of the said email address(es), constitutes notice to the group, whether or not any Admin(s) receive(s) or views such email.<br /><br />
			2.5 Sub-Groups <br /><br />
			2.5.1 What is a Sub-Group?  Admins of registered groups can create lists and then choose certain Followers of the group to populate the list.   We call these lists “sub-groups”.   An example of a sub-group may be the “Wolf Patrol” of the registered group “Boy Scout Troup 87”.  All the Admins of the registered group have management authority for all the group’s sub-groups.<br /><br />
			2.5.2 Purpose of Sub-Groups:  The sole purpose of a sub-group is to assist the registered group to communicate more effectively with its Followers.  Specifically, a registered group can send messages to only a portion of its Followers rather than to all its Followers by limiting the recipients of the message to one or more of its sub-groups.  Admins should take care and are responsible for sending Messages to its intended recipients by selecting the proper sub-group and making sure the proper/intended Followers are in the sub-group.<br /><br />
			2.5.3 Creating Sub-Groups and Following:  Admins of registered groups create and populate its sub-groups, and these sub-groups may be changed, deleted and controlled by the registered group’s Admins.  Therefore, Followers (i.e. non-Admins) of a group do not determine what sub-group(s) to which they are included. <br /><br />
			2.6 Groups’ GroupPost Page<br /><br />
			2.6.1 Public View: The following elements of each registered groups’ GroupPost Page is visible to all Users: (1) group name; (2) group city, state and zip code; (3) the group’s primary Admin (4) group description (if any provided); (5) group logo (if any provided); (6) group address (if any provided); and (7) webpage link (if any provided). Additionally, any User, not currently following a group, will be able to request to follow the group and report the group to GroupPost.<br /><br />
			2.6.2 Follower View:  Users, who are following a group, will be able to view all the elements visible to Non-Follower Uses, as set out above in Section 2.6.1.  Additionally, Followers can view an archive of Messages that any Admin for group sent the User/Follower or was earlier sent to a sub-group that the Follower is later included.  Yet, management functions of a group’s GroupPost Page will not visible to Followers unless he/she is also an Admin of the group.<br /><br />
			2.6.3 Admin View:  As any other Follower, Admins will be able to view all elements of the group’s GroupPost page, as set out in Sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.2.  Additionally, all Admins will be able to view the names of all the group’s Followers and other Admins and may remove any Follower or other Admin at any time at the Admins’ discretion.  (Yet, Admins cannot view any Settings information of its Followers other than the Followers first and last name.  See Privacy Policy).  Important Note: All Admins will be able to view all the Messages sent to any Followers of the group no matter if the Admin is/was/becomes part of a sub-group to whom the Message was sent<br /><br />
			2.6.4 Page Content Storage Limit:  GroupPost will maintain an archive of the content described in Section 2.6.3.  Yet, this content will remain on groups’ Pages for limited amount of time as determined by GroupPost at its discretion, but in no case shall be less than 30 days.<br /><br />
